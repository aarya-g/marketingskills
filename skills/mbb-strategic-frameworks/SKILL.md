## 1. MCKINSEY: STRUCTURED PROBLEM SOLVING

### Core Philosophy
- Solutions must be: **Fact-based**, **Rigidly structured**, **Hypothesis-driven**
- Priority hierarchy: Client > Firm > You
- "Facts are the bricks with which you will lay a path to your solution"

### Problem-Solving Method

**Step 1: Generate Initial Hypothesis (IH)**
- Start with the answer, then prove/disprove
- IH = "a road map, albeit hastily sketched, to take you from problem to solution"
- Process: Start with facts → absorb industry flavor → seek internal experts

**Step 2: Kick the Tires**
- Is this the best possible hypothesis?
- Are all recommendations actionable and provable?
- Are all drivers considered?

**Step 3: Pivot or Persist**
- "If facts prove you wrong, adjust to the facts. Don't try to pound them into your framework"
- A hypothesis is a theory to be proved/disproved, NOT the answer

### MECE Principle
- **Mutually Exclusive**: Each issue is separate and distinct (no overlap)
- **Collectively Exhaustive**: Every aspect of the problem falls under one issue
- "Other Issues" bucket allowed as safety net but avoid in top-line presentations
- Optimal issue tree: 2-5 top-line issues (3 is best)
- Break top-line into sub-issues → determine analyses needed to prove/disprove

### Mental Models
- **80/20 Rule**: Focus on clumps where 80% of results come from 20% of inputs
- **Forces at Work**: Map suppliers, customers, competitors, substitutes + changes in each
- **Key Drivers**: Identify the 3 most important factors; ignore the rest
- **Square Law**: If problem complexity doubles, solve time quadruples unless you simplify

### Decision Rules
- **Elevator Test**: Can you explain your solution to the CEO in 30 seconds?
- **Don't Boil the Ocean**: Be selective; analyze only what proves/disproves the hypothesis
- **Hit Singles**: Consistent reliable output > unsustainable heroics
- **Don't Reinvent the Wheel**: Check if the Firm already has relevant frameworks/data

### Communication
- One message per chart; one sentence lead per chart
- Waterfall charts for quantitative flows
- Effective messaging = Brevity + Thoroughness + Structure
- **Prewiring**: Walk all stakeholders through findings individually before group presentation
- Finish presentation documents at least 24 hours before delivery

### Key Benchmarks (McKinsey)
- 5 extra ppts of revenue/year → 3-4 extra ppts of TSR
- 80% of growth comes from core industry; 20% from adjacent
- 8 out of 10 pricing problems → answer is "raise your prices"
- Revenue growth accounts for ~60% of value created over 5-10 years
- ROIC must exceed cost of capital for value creation
- "Growth without advantage buys size but creates no value"
- Target 4:1 ratio of engineers to managers (vs 1:1 common)
- 70% of executives take actions harming long-term growth for short-term goals
- Minimum 5% of revenue investment threshold for digital transformation

### Signature Frameworks
- **VECTOR**: Vision, Employees, Culture/mindset, Technology, Organization, Routines
- **Ten Rules of Growth**: Empirical blueprint for value-creating growth
- **Three Horizons**: Protect/extend core, build emerging, create options for future
- **Geopolitical Classification**: Black swans, gray rhinos, silver linings

## 2. BCG: COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE & EXPERIENCE CURVES

### Core Philosophy
- "All competitors who persist must maintain a unique advantage by differentiation"
- Strategic competition = revolutionary; natural competition = evolutionary
- "Everything interesting in business lies in fourth-order effects and beyond"
- Transformation = fundamental reboot, not incremental improvement

### Growth-Share Matrix

| Quadrant | Share | Growth | Cash Role |
|----------|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Stars** | High | High | Cash-neutral (invest to maintain) |
| **Cash Cows** | High | Low | Cash generators (harvest) |
| **Question Marks** | Low | High | Cash users (invest or divest) |
| **Pets** | Low | Low | Cash traps (divest) |

**Decision Rules:**
- 2:1 market share ratio = equilibrium point (neither practical to increase or decrease)
- <30% of relevant market OR <50% of leader's share = high-risk position
- Optimal industry: 3 competitors, largest ≤60% share, smallest ≥15% share
- "Take at least twice as much of the growth as your leading competitor, or plan exit"

### Experience Curve

**Core Math:**
- Cost of value added declines 20-30% each time accumulated experience doubles
- Normal slope: 70-80% (steeper where more value is added)
- Capital cost increases by the 0.6 power of capacity increase (52% more capital for 100% more capacity)
- Labor output increases 10-15% per doubling of total output (baseline learning)

**Strategic Implications:**
- 2:1 market share difference → 5-8% cost advantage in value added
- Advertising cost per unit halved with each doubling of volume
- The low-cost producer should depress prices to capacity utilization
- Average costing creates an "umbrella" that lets smaller competitors cherry-pick

### Time-Based Competition
- Products receive value for only 0.05%-2.5% of time in factory
- Target: Reduce new product development from 36-48 months to 12-18 months

### Competitive Dynamics
- **Rule of Three and Four**: Stable market = max 3 significant competitors; largest ≤4x smallest
- Dominant producer MUST increase market share steadily (failure = failure to compete)
- New entrants must win in a specific segment first (specialization), not whole market
- Effective competition produces stable spectrum from very large to very small

### Mental Models
- **O.O.D.A. Loop**: Observe → Orient → Decide → Act (faster than rivals = wins)
- **Richness vs. Reach**: Technology deconstructs tradeoff between information depth and breadth
- **Change Curve**: Stagnation → Preparation → Implementation → Determination → Fruition
- **Strategic Sectors**: Define competition by segments where you have specific edge
- **Three Flywheels**: Growth (network effects), Data (learning effects), Cost (scale effects)

### Transformation Framework
- **Three-Part Structure**: Fund the Journey (short-term wins) → Win in Medium Term (business model shifts) → Organize for Sustained Performance (culture/people)
- **Change Delta**: Enabled Leaders + Executional Certainty + Engaged Organization + Governance/PMO
- **Six Digital Success Factors**: Integrated strategy, Leadership commitment, High-caliber talent, Agile governance, Effective monitoring, Modular tech/data platform (flips success odds from 30% → 80%)

### Key Benchmarks (BCG)
- Pricing improvement → 3-10 ppts EBITDA improvement
- Typical manufacturing: <7% pretax profit on sales = cash trap
- New Luxury = $400B market growing 10-15% annually
- Toyota supplier transaction costs = 1/8th of GM's
- Grocery: middle lost 24% share; downscale gained 23% ("death in the middle")
- Service contract renewal 3x rate with on-site service vs without
- Toyota outsources ~75% of component costs vs US OEMs at <50%
- Successful transformations → +11 ppts growth acceleration, +12 ppts TSR outperformance
- 300+ ecosystem startups reached unicorn status since 2015
- <15% of ecosystems sustainable long-term
- Average US director: ~100 hours/year on the job

## 3. BAIN: RESULTS DELIVERY & LOYALTY

### Core Philosophy
- "Selling outcomes, not projects" — linked fees to client results
- "Organizations don't change, people do"
- Golden Rule = NPS foundation: treat customers as you'd want to be treated
- Clients outperformed stock market 4:1
- Only 12% of companies fully achieve change initiative goals

### Net Promoter System (NPS)

**Calculation:**
- Ask: "How likely would you recommend?" (0-10 scale)
- Promoters (9-10) minus Detractors (0-6) = NPS
- Passives (7-8) = neutral

**Key Data:**
- Loyalty leader grows 2x+ faster than competitors
- Promoters stay longer, buy more; detractors spread negative WOM, increase costs
- AmEx: 50% lower employee attrition in US service centers after launching NPS
- Sprint: 30% increase in conversion rates from data-driven segmentation

**System Architecture:**
- **Inner Loop**: Real-time feedback to front line
- **Outer Loop**: Prioritize structural customer-friendly changes
- **Litmus Test**: "Is this right for the customer AND economically appropriate for the firm?"

### Results Delivery®

**Three Phases:**
1. **Installation**: Put new systems/processes in place
2. **Realization**: Achieve behavioral changes and business benefits
3. **Repeatability**: Embed capabilities that increase ongoing capacity

**Key Insight**: Most efforts fail at Installation → Realization gap. 90% of effort is spent "pushing" change down; only 10% on "pulling" new behaviors.

**Critical Tools:**
- **Sponsorship Spine**: Unbroken chain from front line to C-suite (no "black holes")
- **Enrollment Cascade**: Each level explains decisions and asks for input; every employee hears from direct supervisor
- **Heat Map**: 2x2 of group importance × degree of disruption → focus change support
- **Risk Assessment**: 1. Understand failure modes, 2. Identify 4-5 biggest threats, 3. Sequence risks, 4. Identify containment tools

**Behavioral Science:**
- Real-time feedback loops are **4x more powerful** than training programs
- In high-stress situations, people process only **20% of information**
- Full attention lasts **12 minutes or less** under stress (vs 1 hour normal)
- Employees judge leader credibility within **30 seconds**
- 65% of initiatives require significant behavioral change that managers fail to plan for

### Full Potential Methodology
- Cross-functional effort to alter financial, operational, and strategic trajectory
- Produces "game-changing results"
- Value creation levers: pricing, salesforce effectiveness, product innovation

### M&A Framework
- **Scale Deals**: Consolidate to strengthen leadership and lower costs
- **Scope Deals**: Acquire faster-growing segments or new capabilities
- **Natural Owner Test**: Are you the buyer who can extract more value than anyone else?
- **Standalone vs. Integrated**: Choice shapes target selection and org changes required
- Frequent acquirers: 8.5% TSR growth vs 3.7% for inactive companies
- Serial acquirers in O&G: 130% higher TSR than inactive (2012-2022)
- Transformative deals = >50% of acquirer's market cap
- Insurgent brands = growing 10x category with >$25M revenue

### Key Benchmarks (Bain)
- 20% of change efforts fail completely; 68% achieve less than 100% of ambition
- 30% of new CEOs last <2 years; 44% last <3 years
- 70% of companies 4+ years old in PE portfolios doing "just OK or worse"
- PE interest coverage dropped to 2.4x EBITDA (lowest since 2007)
- Value creation: Revenue growth (27.4), Margin expansion (0.1), Multiple expansion (24.0)
- Strategy-led buy-and-build MOIC: 2.2x vs pure multiple arbitrage at 1.4x
- 2025 M&A: up 40% value to ~$4.9T, 7% volume increase
- Megadeals (>$5B) = 73% of 2025 deal value increase
- AI-enabled analytics: process data in <10% of time vs manual

## 4. CROSS-FIRM COMPARATIVE POSITIONING

| Dimension | McKinsey | BCG | Bain |
|-----------|----------|-----|------|
| **Identity** | Capability builder ("superpowers") | Intellectual provocateur ("begin a conversation") | Results partner ("selling outcomes") |
| **Primary Tool** | MECE + Issue Trees | Experience Curve + Growth-Share | NPS + Results Delivery |
| **Value Logic** | ROIC > cost of capital | Accumulated volume drives cost leadership | Loyalty drives organic growth |
| **Growth Logic** | 10 Rules of Growth | Three Flywheels | Full Potential + M&A |
| **Change Logic** | VECTOR (capability building) | Three-Part Transformation | Installation → Realization → Repeatability |
| **Risk View** | Black swans / gray rhinos | Governance as #1 failure mode (>1/3 of cases) | 40+ specific risks; few determine success |
| **M&A View** | Digital rewiring + AI | Ecosystem winner-takes-most | Scale vs Scope deals |
| **Pricing** | "Raise your prices" (80% of cases) | Experience curve pricing to preempt | Value-based via loyalty economics |

## 5. UNIVERSAL DECISION RULES (APPLY TO ALL ANALYSIS)

### Problem Structuring
1. Start with hypothesis → prove/disprove with data
2. Structure MECE (2-5 top-line issues, 3 ideal)
3. Apply 80/20 to focus on decision-driving data
4. Every finding must pass the "So What?" test
5. If it doesn't change a decision, skip it

### Value Creation Test
- ROIC must exceed cost of capital
- Growth without advantage = no value
- Revenue growth is 60% of long-term value; margin is secondary
- Extra 5ppts revenue → 3-4ppts TSR

### Competitive Position Assessment
- Are you at 2:1 share ratio vs nearest competitor?
- Are you above 30% of relevant market?
- Are you capturing 2x the market growth vs leader?
- If NO to all: plan exit or niche repositioning

### Transformation Readiness
- Is investment ≥5% of revenue? (BCG minimum threshold)
- Is sponsorship spine unbroken? (Bain)
- Are you addressing all 6 digital success factors? (BCG)
- Are you measuring behavioral change, not just installation? (Bain)

### Communication Standard
- Elevator test: 30 seconds to explain
- One message per chart
- Prewire all stakeholders before group presentations
- Three recommendations maximum for high-stakes moments

## 6. APPLICATION TO GSG INDIA MARKETING

When applying these frameworks to K-12 education marketing decisions:

### Market Position Analysis
- Use Growth-Share Matrix to classify each brand (GIIS, OWIS, Witty, Glendale, Vikaasa) by city
- Apply Rule of Three and Four to assess competitive viability per micro-market
- Experience curve logic: campus with highest enrollment should have lowest CPA

### Growth Strategy
- Apply "2x growth capture" rule: GSG must capture 2x the enrollment growth of nearest competitor in each city
- Use McKinsey's 80/20: identify the 20% of lead sources driving 80% of enrollments
- Full Potential methodology for underperforming campuses

### Customer Loyalty
- NPS measurement per campus and brand
- Promoter/Detractor economics → calculate referral value
- Inner/Outer Loop: parent feedback → immediate counselor response (inner) → structural campus improvements (outer)

### Pricing
- BCG: Avoid "death in the middle" — each brand must be clearly premium or value-positioned
- McKinsey: In 8/10 pricing cases, the answer is raise prices (test for premium brands)
- Experience curve: marketing cost per enrollment should decline with campus scale

### Transformation
- Use Bain's Results Delivery for any marketing process change (CRM adoption, referral programs)
- Expect 65% of initiatives to require behavioral change from staff
- Design for 12-minute attention spans in training/rollout communications
