# Marketing Execution & Persuasion Skill

Use this skill when the task involves: ad creative development, campaign architecture,
offer design, pricing psychology, media buying decisions, creative testing protocols,
competitive positioning tactics, product-desire mapping, or persuasion-based communication.

This skill is Tier 4 (execution heuristics). When it conflicts with Tier 1 (MBB) or Tier 2
(INTEL files), defer to higher tiers. Use this for HOW to execute, not WHAT to prioritize.

## 1. BREAKTHROUGH ADVERTISING: AWARENESS & SOPHISTICATION

### Core Philosophy
- "Copy cannot create desire. It can only take hopes, dreams, fears and desires that already exist and focus them onto a particular product."
- The copywriter's job is to CHANNEL existing market desire, not manufacture it
- $1 spent on advertising can create $50-$100 in sales when it directs existing social forces
- "Analysis is the art of asking the right questions and letting the problem dictate the right answers"

### 5 Stages of Market Awareness

Determines WHAT information leads your ad:

| Stage | Prospect State | Headline Strategy | GSG Application |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1. Most Aware | Knows product, wants it | Name + price/offer | Returning families, siblings |
| 2. Product Aware | Knows product, not convinced | Reinforce desire, sharpen satisfaction image | Parents who visited campus |
| 3. Desire Aware | Has the want, doesn't know product | Name the desire, present solution | "Best school for my child" searchers |
| 4. Need Aware | Has need, no connection to solution | Name the need, product as inevitable answer | Parents unhappy with current school |
| 5. Completely Unaware | No awareness of desire/need | Identification — echo emotion/attitude | General brand awareness campaigns |

**Decision Rule:** "If he is aware of your product, your headline starts with your product. If he is not aware, your headline starts with the desire."

### 5 Stages of Market Sophistication

Determines HOW your ad must evolve as competition saturates:

| Stage | Market State | Strategy | GSG Application |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| 1st | You're first | Simple, direct claim | New city with no premium competitors |
| 2nd | You're second | Enlarge the claim to its limit | Established market, outbid competitor claims |
| 3rd | Claims exhausted | Introduce NEW MECHANISM | "How" matters more than "what" — show methodology |
| 4th | Mechanisms copied | Elaborate the mechanism | More detail, faster, easier, surer version |
| 5th | Market disbelieves ads | Shift to IDENTIFICATION | Lead with parent identity, not school features |

**Key threshold:** When claims are "discounted 50% by readers" → market has shifted from 2nd to 3rd stage. When "volume falls off even though ad budgets increase" → market has reached 5th stage.

### Three Stages of Copywriting
1. Choose the most powerful desire (urgency × staying power × scope)
2. Acknowledge that desire in the headline — reinforce it or offer satisfaction
3. Show how product performances satisfy that desire

### Three Dimensions of Mass Desire
- **Urgency**: How badly do they want it NOW?
- **Staying Power**: Will this desire persist or fade?
- **Scope**: How many people share this desire?

### Product Analysis Framework
1. List every performance the product contains
2. Group performances against the mass desires they satisfy
3. Feature the ONE dominant performance that taps greatest sales power at this time

### Key Distinctions
- **Physical Product vs. Functional Product**: physical = buildings/classrooms; functional = "what it does for the child's future"
- **Desire vs. Awareness**: desire is the engine; awareness is the location
- **Claim vs. Mechanism**: claim = "what it does"; mechanism = "how it works"

### Warnings
- **No Echo Ads**: don't substitute words into competitors' successful headlines
- **No Formula Works Twice**: "rules must be replaced by analysis"
- A headline that works at one awareness stage WILL NOT work at another

## 2. 100M MONEY MODELS: OFFER ARCHITECTURE & PRICING

### Offer Architecture (4 Categories)

**A. Attraction Offers** (get them in the door)

| Type | Mechanic | GSG Application |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Giveaway | Grand prize + "killer discount" for non-winners; contact info + qualifying questions | "Win a year's tuition" contest; non-winners get fee waiver |
| Decoy Offer | Free/cheap offer shown alongside premium; premium looks much more valuable | Free school assessment day vs. premium counseling package |
| Buy X Get Y | Raise price of one item, add another "free"; reframe | "Enroll for 10 months, 2 months free" |
| Win Your Money Back | Accountability challenge; ~10% ask for refund; rest stay | "Academic improvement guarantee" challenge |
| Pay Less Now / Pay More Later | Low upfront + higher deferred OR low now if results met | ₹97K registration now, or ₹2.97L if you wait |

**B. Upsell Offers** (increase transaction value)

| Type | Mechanic | GSG Application |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Anchor Upsell | Show very expensive option first; target price seems reasonable | Show IB programme fees first, then CBSE seems affordable |
| Classic Upsell | Stack sequential add-ons solving next problem | Transport → meals → after-school → summer camp |
| Menu Upsell | 4-step: Unsell → Prescribe → Ask A or B → Easy payment | Counselor consultation flow |
| Rollover Upsell | Monthly discount rolls over if they commit to 12 months | Fee discount that increases with each year of retention |

**C. Downsell Offers** (save the sale when they say no)

| Type | Mechanic | Rule |
|------|----------|------|
| Payment Plan | 7-step: Full price → Financing → 2 payments → Scale 1-10 → 3 payments → Spread → Trial | "Start high, work down"; schedule on paycheck day |
| Feature Downsell | Lower price by changing WHAT they get (less quantity, lower tier) | Move from IB to CBSE, or from premium to standard campus |
| Trial with Condition | Free trial requiring specific action; credit card upfront | "Attend 1 week free; if your child loves it, continue" |

**D. Continuity Offers** (lock in recurring revenue)

| Type | Mechanic | GSG Application |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Bonus Offer | VIP perks for annual/multi-year commitment | Priority admission for siblings, exclusive parent events |
| Continuity Discount | 4 timing options: upfront, at end, after 2 payments, spread over time | "Pay 3 years upfront, get 4th year free" |
| Waved Fee Offer | Large upfront fee + monthly OR wave fee for 12-month commitment; quitting triggers fee | Registration fee waived for multi-year commitment |

### Pricing Psychology Rules
- **"Free" > any discount** for attention capture
- **"No" = "no to THIS offer"** — always have a downsell ready
- **Never lower price of the SAME thing** — it kills trust; change what they get instead
- **Turkey Talk**: results can't be rushed ("doubling the heat burns the turkey") — justifies longer commitment
- **Price anchoring**: show 7x the target price first; everything else seems cheap
- **Refund rule**: ~10% will ask for money back; if you can't stomach 10%, don't do the offer
- **Buy 1 Get 2 > Buy 2 Get 1**: more compelling because of higher perceived "free" volume

### Sales Diagnostic
- Scale of 1-10: if 8+, keep working; if 7 or below, ask "why not 10?"
- Identifies the specific objection (price, timing, trust, spouse, feature)

## 3. 48 LAWS: COMPETITIVE POSITIONING & INFLUENCE

### Laws Most Relevant to Marketing & Competitive Dynamics

**Reputation & Brand**
- **Law 5 — Guard Reputation**: reputation is cornerstone of power; once it slips, you're attacked on all sides. For GSG: protect brand perception relentlessly; one viral parent complaint = reputation crisis
- **Law 6 — Court Attention**: everything judged by appearance; what is unseen counts for nothing. For GSG: campus aesthetics, event quality, digital presence all signal quality
- **Law 25 — Recreate Yourself**: forge new identity that commands attention. For GSG: each brand should have distinct identity, not be a diluted version of GIIS
- **Law 37 — Compelling Spectacles**: grand symbolic gestures create aura of power. For GSG: flagship events, award ceremonies, high-profile partnerships
- **Law 46 — Never Appear Too Perfect**: display harmless defects to deflect envy. For GSG: acknowledge areas of improvement in parent communications; builds trust

**Competitive Strategy**
- **Law 15 — Crush Enemies Totally**: leaving an ember causes fires. For GSG: when entering a new micro-market, commit fully; half-measures invite competitive retaliation
- **Law 16 — Use Absence for Scarcity**: too much circulation = price goes down. For GSG: limited seats, waitlists, selective admissions create perceived value
- **Law 23 — Concentrate Forces**: intensity defeats extensity. For GSG: better to dominate 3 cities than spread thin across 8
- **Law 29 — Plan to the End**: the ending is everything. For GSG: plan the full enrollment journey before launching a campaign
- **Law 42 — Strike the Shepherd**: trace trouble to a single source. For GSG: identify the key decision-maker (usually mother) and focus messaging there

**Persuasion & Sales**
- **Law 4 — Say Less**: the more you say, the more common you appear. For GSG: premium brands should communicate sparingly and with authority
- **Law 9 — Win Through Actions**: demonstration > argument. For GSG: campus visits, student achievements, testimonials > claims in ads
- **Law 12 — Selective Honesty Disarms**: one sincere move covers many. For GSG: transparent fee communication builds trust
- **Law 13 — Appeal to Self-Interest**: when asking for referrals, show what's in it for the referring parent (sibling discount, priority)
- **Law 27 — Create Cult-Like Following**: vague promises + enthusiasm + rituals. For GSG: alumni events, parent communities, school traditions create belonging
- **Law 32 — Play to Fantasies**: never appeal to harsh reality. For GSG: sell the aspirational future (child's career, global citizenship) not the daily grind
- **Law 43 — Work on Hearts and Minds**: coercion creates reaction; seduce instead. For GSG: don't pressure-sell; build desire through stories and social proof

**Timing**
- **Law 35 — Master Timing**: never seem in a hurry; detect the right moment. For GSG: enrollment seasonality, market readiness signals
- **Law 45 — Never Reform Too Much at Once**: show respect for old ways when new to a market. For GSG: new campus launches should honor local education culture
- **Law 47 — Know When to Stop**: moment of victory = greatest peril. For GSG: don't over-expand during enrollment peaks; consolidate

## 4. GOOGLE ADS: PERFORMANCE MAX & VALUE-BASED BIDDING

### Strategic Foundation
- Start from business goals (revenue, profit, market share) → translate to digital KPIs (ROAS, value per lead)
- Value-centric measurement: define which conversions matter, assign explicit monetary values
- AI + human input: AI improves performance by ~20%; human input adds another ~15%
- Switching from target CPA to target ROAS = **+14% more conversions** at similar spend

### Bidding Strategy Selection

| Strategy | Use When | Trade-off |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Maximize Conversion Value | Budget is fixed, want most revenue | May accept low-ROAS conversions |
| Target ROAS | Efficiency/profitability threshold is critical | May limit volume to protect ROAS |
| Target CPA | Simple lead gen, volume focus | Doesn't differentiate lead quality |

**For GSG:** Target ROAS preferred — not all leads are equal; a GIIS premium inquiry worth more than a Glendale budget inquiry.

### Keyword Strategy
- **Broad match + Smart Bidding** = 20% more conversions vs. manual
- No need to duplicate same keyword across exact/phrase/broad — broad covers all
- Theme ad groups for relevance
- Use negative keywords surgically (not broadly)
- Broad match discovers queries you'd never think to bid on

### Performance Max
- Runs across Search, YouTube, Display, Discover, Gmail, Maps
- Average **+13% incremental conversions** at similar CPA
- Prerequisites: Search fundamentals must be solid first
- Inputs: goals, conversion values, audience signals, rich creative assets
- Use Audience Signals to steer automation (e.g., parents who visited site but didn't apply)

### Creative Best Practices
- Responsive Search Ads: 15 headlines + 4 descriptions; each unique and distinct
- Improving ad strength from "Poor" to "Excellent" = **+9% more clicks and conversions**
- Non-white backgrounds perform stronger
- Center 80% of image = most important content
- Provide both square and landscape ratios

### Lead Gen Specific
- Use Offline Conversion Import (OCI): tell Google what "quality lead" means by importing qualified leads from CRM
- Enhanced Conversions for Leads: easiest way to upload offline data
- Use qualifying questions and reCAPTCHA in lead forms to filter quality
- Value-based bidding: assign different values to form submissions vs. phone calls

### Test-Learn-Scale
- Run structured A/B experiments before scaling changes
- Use Insights page for root cause of performance fluctuations
- Conversion Lift experiments measure true incrementality
- Always-on mindset: continuous improvement, not campaign-by-campaign

## 5. ONE CAMPAIGN METHOD (OCM): META ADS EXECUTION

### Three Profitability Pillars
1. SOP & Media Buying Strategy (OCM)
2. SOP & Marketing Strategy
3. Business Analytics Strategy & SOP

### Core Philosophy
- "You cannot create new desires; you can only serve desires available in the market"
- "Who understands the customers most dominates"
- 99% of people fail because they're not testing unique ad concepts
- Creative is the #1 lever — "first winning creative, then budget"

### Ad Auction Mechanics
- Total value = **Bid × Estimated Action Rate × Ad Quality**
- Anyone on auto bid with higher budget will dominate
- Audience fragmentation → overlapping audiences → competing with yourself
- Solution: consolidate into fewer campaigns/ad sets

### Campaign Structures

**1:5:3 Framework (New Account, No Data)**
- 1 Campaign (Advantage Campaign Budget)
- 5 Ad Sets (one unique audience interest each)
- 3 Ads per ad set (same creative, 3 variations of copy/hook/headline)
- Need: 1 creative, 1 primary text, 3 hooks, 3 headlines

**1:1:3 Framework (Testing New Creative)**
- 1 Campaign, 1 Ad Set, 3 Ads
- Use for launching new tests to find winning ads
- If MAS (Manual Ad Set) already working, launch test inside MAS

**OCM MC (Main Campaign)**
- One MAS per country
- Capacity: up to 50 ads per MAS
- Never turn off the campaign; only turn off individual ads

### Creative Testing Protocol
- **Ratio: 60% iteration / 20% variation / 20% new concept** (adjust based on what's working)
- Test ONE variable at a time (design, overlay text, hook, header text, ad copy)
- Weekly creative test launches (fixed day, e.g., every Monday)
- Creative is the lagging indicator → measure by target CPA
- Leading indicators: CTR, hold rate, hook rate, CPM, CPC

### Creative Production Workflow
1. Analyze working script/ad
2. Check product page
3. Share both with AI for ideation
4. Search ad libraries for inspo (any industry, best performing, longest running)
5. Ideate new concept
6. Write hooks/overlay texts first
7. Zero in on awareness stage (usually "most aware" for direct response)
8. Finalize hook → buyer persona → first draft → specific relatable event → final script → visuals

### Ad Design Types
| Type | Style | Use For |
|------|-------|---------|
| Polished | Magazine-quality, pro look, clean | Branding ads, trust building |
| Native/UGC | Less polished, real-life, social-media-style | Conversion ads, social proof |
| Smart Brand | Mix both | Brand awareness + conversion |

### CPM & Frequency Matrix
| CPM | Frequency | Diagnosis |
|-----|-----------|-----------|
| High | High | Good BOF (bottom of funnel) ad |
| Low | Low | Good TOF (top of funnel) ad |
| High | Low | Bad ad — kill it |

### When to Turn Off
- **Campaign**: Never
- **Ad Set**: When MAS reaches 50 ads capacity, or launching different product
- **Ad**: When CPA rises above target

### Scaling SOP
- Mindset: first winning creative, then budget
- Work on creative scaling SOP in parallel — weekly habit
- Budget scaling follows creative scaling, not the other way around

---

## 6. DASH METHOD: DESIRE-FIRST ADVERTISING FRAMEWORK

### Core Philosophy
- Desires already exist within the market — advertisers do NOT create them (Steven Reiss: 16 basic desires drive all human behavior)
- Marketer's role: **identify** the strongest existing desire → **channel** it toward a product/service
- Strong desire = surfing high waves (smooth, effortless, fast scaling)
- Weak desire = struggling upstream (slow, tiresome, limited growth)
- "Humans do not respond immediately without knowing the functional benefit or logic"

### The Three Types of Desire

| Type | Definition | How to Find | Example (GSG) |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Material** | Features + functional/tangible benefits the market wants | **Identify** through market research (reviews, forums, surveys, pattern recognition) | "I want my child to get into a top university" |
| **Emotional** | How the market wants to FEEL | **Conclude** from identified material desire | "I want to feel confident I made the right choice for my child" |
| **Aspirational (Internal)** | Who they want to BECOME for themselves | **Conclude** from material and/or emotional | "I want to be a parent who prioritized my child's future" |
| **Aspirational (External)** | How they want to be SEEN by others | **Conclude** from material and/or emotional | "I want my family/community to see me as someone who invested wisely in education" |

**Derivation Chain:** Material (identify via research) → Emotional (conclude) → Aspirational (conclude). Always start with material. Never start with emotional or aspirational.

### Product Anatomy
```
Product = Mechanisms + Features + Benefits
```
- **Mechanisms**: how it works (curriculum system, teaching methodology, assessment process)
- **Features**: what you get (class size, facilities, extra-curriculars, certifications)
- **Benefits**: why it matters — 3 types:
  - Functional/Tangible: practical outcome (university placements, exam scores)
  - Emotional: how it makes you feel (peace of mind, pride)
  - Aspirational: who you become / how you're seen (global citizen, accomplished parent)

### Desire vs. Product — The Two Perspectives

**Target Market (Demand Side):** "What does my market want?" = **Desire**
- Flows UP: Benefits desired → Features expected → Mechanisms believed necessary

**Product (Supply Side):** "What does my product deliver?" = **Benefits**
- Flows DOWN: Mechanisms built → Features offered → Benefits delivered

**Why this separation matters:**
1. **Prevents mismatch**: stops selling benefits the market doesn't care about
2. **Identifies gaps**: highlights where product needs improvement or repositioning
3. **Generates ad angles**: determines whether to lead with material ("IB curriculum with 95% university placement") or emotional/aspirational ("Give your child the confidence to thrive anywhere")

### Mass Material Desire
- Definition: the feature/functional benefit that the **majority** of the target market wants
- Rule: many material desires exist, but ONE always dominates — this is the Mass Material Desire
- **If you don't communicate how your product fulfills this mass desire, you CANNOT scale**
- Identification: pattern recognition through market research (or ML-assisted analysis)

### Product Desire Mapping (4-Step Execution)

**Step 1 — Product's Material Value:** Map Mechanisms → Features → Functional/Tangible Benefits

**Step 2 — Current Target & Positioning:** Document what benefits, problems, and features are currently being communicated

**Step 3 — Mass Material Desire:** Research what the target market actually wants (Benefits → Features → Mechanisms they believe they need)

**Step 4 — Analysis:** Map product value against market desire. Identify alignment or mismatch.

### Product-Desire Mismatch Resolution

| Option | What Changes | What Stays | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 1. Redo Positioning | Marketing message | Product + Target | Product delivers what market wants, but messaging doesn't communicate it |
| 2. Redo Product + Positioning | Product + Message | Target market | Market wants something the product doesn't deliver; build it |
| 3. Redo Target + Positioning | Target market + Message | Product | Product is good but wrong audience; find the segment that wants this |

### Marketing Strategy × Desire Split

| Strategy | Desire Mix | Channel | Action Expected | Measurable |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----------------|------------|
| **Institutional (Branding)** | 80% Aspirational/Emotional + 20% Material | TV, Display, YouTube brand | No | No |
| **Direct Response** | 80% Material + 20% Aspirational/Emotional | Meta Conversion, Google Search | Yes | Yes |

**Rule:** Branding-style ads fail on Meta at scale because they violate direct response principles. Meta conversion = always lead with material desire.

### DASH Applied to GSG Ad Development

**For Meta Conversion Ads (direct response):**
1. Identify mass material desire per brand/city through parent research
2. Lead with material desire in hook/headline: "IB curriculum. 95% university placement rate."
3. Layer emotional in body: "Because you want peace of mind about their future."
4. Close with aspirational: "Join 45,000 families shaping global citizens."

**For YouTube/Display (institutional):**
1. Lead with aspirational/emotional: parent identity, child's potential, community belonging
2. Support with material proof points (placements, awards, facilities)
3. No hard CTA — build brand recall and trust

## 7. CROSS-SOURCE INTEGRATION RULES

### Awareness Stage → Campaign Type Mapping

| Awareness Stage | Best Channel | Schwartz Logic | OCM Execution | Google Execution |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Most Aware | Retargeting, Email, Referral | Product name + offer | Iteration of winning ad | RLSA, Customer Match |
| Product Aware | Search, Campus Visit | Reinforce desire | Variation of winning concept | Exact/Phrase match branded |
| Desire Aware | Search (non-brand), Meta | Name the desire | New concept, desire-first hook | Broad match + Smart Bidding |
| Need Aware | Meta, Display, Content | Name the need → solution | New concept, problem-aware | Performance Max, Display |
| Unaware | YouTube, Display, Events | Identification only | Brand/polished creative | Video campaigns, PMax |

### Offer Architecture → Enrollment Funnel Mapping

| Funnel Stage | Offer Type | Example |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Lead Generation | Attraction (Giveaway/Decoy) | Free assessment day, school guide download |
| Campus Visit | Attraction (Pay Less Now) | "Register now, save ₹X on application fee" |
| Application | Upsell (Menu) | Counselor consultation → programme recommendation |
| Assessment → Admission | Downsell (Feature/Payment Plan) | Alternative programme, EMI options |
| Enrollment → Retention | Continuity (Bonus/Discount/Waved) | Multi-year commitment, sibling discount |

### Competitive Positioning Protocol
1. Identify market sophistication stage (Schwartz) for each city
2. Map competitor claims (what are they saying?)
3. If Stage 1-2: outbid claims with bigger/bolder version
4. If Stage 3: introduce new mechanism (unique pedagogy, outcome guarantee)
5. If Stage 4-5: shift to identification (parent identity, community belonging)
6. Apply Law 23 (concentrate forces) — dominate one micro-market before expanding
7. Apply Law 16 (scarcity) — limited seats, selective admission, waitlists

### Creative Development Protocol
1. **Product Desire Mapping** (DASH Steps 1-4): map product value vs. mass material desire; resolve any mismatch first
2. Identify target **awareness stage** for this campaign (Schwartz)
3. Select **desire type** based on channel: material-first for Meta/Search (direct response 80/20), aspirational-first for YouTube/Display (institutional 80/20)
4. Write hooks at material level first, then layer emotional and aspirational
5. Select **market sophistication** response: direct claim (Stage 1-2), mechanism (Stage 3-4), identification (Stage 5)
6. Select campaign structure (1:5:3 for new account, 1:1:3 for testing)
7. Design creative type (polished for brand, native/UGC for conversion)
8. Launch → measure by CPA (lagging) and CTR/CPM/hook rate (leading)
9. Apply 60/20/20 ratio for iteration/variation/new concept
10. Weekly testing cadence (fixed day)

---

## 7. APPLICATION TO GSG INDIA MARKETING

### Brand-Level Awareness Assessment
- **GIIS (premium, established)**: Likely Stage 3-4 sophistication in Bangalore/Mumbai — needs mechanism differentiation, not bigger claims
- **OWIS (international, mid-premium)**: Stage 2-3 in most markets — can still enlarge claims but should prepare mechanisms
- **Witty/Glendale (mid-tier)**: Stage 1-2 in many markets — direct claims about value, results, affordability still work
- **Vikaasa (budget-premium)**: Stage 1 in newer markets — simple, direct positioning

### Channel Priority by GSG Objective
- **CPA <2%**: maximize referral share (lowest CPA channel); use OCM 1:1:3 for creative testing on Meta
- **Lead-to-enrollment 6-8%**: improve mid-funnel with Google Search (high intent) + retargeting; apply Schwartz Stage 2 messaging to campus visit follow-up
- **Referral 80%**: apply Law 27 (cult-like following) — build parent community rituals; use continuity offers from Hormozi
- **ROI 5:1**: shift Google from CPA to ROAS bidding; import offline conversions from CRM; assign different values to GIIS vs. Glendale leads

### Fee Communication Strategy
- Apply Law 12 (selective honesty) — transparent fee communication builds trust
- Apply Hormozi anchoring — show total cost of NOT choosing quality education first
- Apply Turkey Talk — "your child's development can't be rushed; investing in 10+ years of quality education"
- Apply Schwartz functional product — sell what the fees BUY (outcomes, opportunities, network) not what they cost
