## 1. PWC: TRUST, REINVENTION & VALUE CREATION

### Core Philosophy
- "Reinvention is not a response to disruption — it's the strategy for growth"
- Trust = financial asset: companies with fewest trust concerns deliver **+9 ppts TSR** over 12 months
- Three dimensions of trust: **Operational** (resilient operations), **Accountability** (quality reporting), **Digital** (data protection + responsible AI)

### Signature Frameworks

**BXT Model (Business × Experience × Technology)**
- Manages interplay between strategy, user adoption, and tech enablement
- Use when: evaluating whether a new tool/platform will actually be adopted

**4-Box Finance Evolution**
1. Scorekeeper → 2. Diligent Caretaker → 3. Communicator → 4. **Business Partner**
- Use when: assessing finance function maturity and CFO strategic contribution

**Connected Compliance**
- "Compliance by design" — embed data flows into organizational DNA
- Compliance Pioneers "speed up, not trip up" — regulation as strategic edge
- Only **7% of companies** consider themselves leading in compliance; **38%** aim to be within 3 years

### Decision Rules
- Capability acquisitions > market power acquisitions (more likely to add value)
- Companies investing boldly despite uncertainty grow faster with higher margins
- "Design for 3 years out, build for today"
- Ready buyer: comprehensive value creation plan **30 days before** deal signing
- Cultural change failure = leading cause of ~50% of integration failures

### M&A Value Creation
- Acquirers prioritizing value creation outperform benchmark by **+14%** at 24 months
- Divestors prioritizing value creation outperform peers by **+6%** at 24 months
- Three steps: 1. Stay true to strategic intent, 2. Comprehensive value creation plan, 3. Culture at the heart
- M&A market is K-shaped: favoring large, US-based, technology-led deals
- Global deal values up **36% in 2025**, driven by ~600 transactions above $1B

### AI Implementation
- Isolated, tactical AI projects don't deliver measurable value
- Enterprise-scale deployment consistent with business strategy required
- AI Foundations: 1. Tech environment, 2. Defined roadmap, 3. Responsible AI processes, 4. Culture enabling adoption
- "Bubble or no bubble, plan for volatility"

### Key Benchmarks (PwC)
- 364,000 people in 136 countries
- Sustainability = ~$1.5B revenue (~2.6% of total FY25)
- Structural forces: Tech acceleration, geostrategic shifts, climate change, demographic bifurcation
- "Line 1.5": Risk and Control Officers embedded directly in business units

## 2. DELOITTE: HUMAN PERFORMANCE & AI TRANSFORMATION

### Core Philosophy
- Human Performance Equation: business outcomes AND human outcomes are mutually reinforcing
- "Leading only for business outcomes isn't leadership: it's an algorithm"
- "Organizations that haven't redesigned work around AI are capturing only surface-level gains"
- Innovation compounds exponentially — "the time it takes to study a new technology now exceeds its relevance window"

### Signature Frameworks

**The Triumvirate Model**
- CIO/CTO + CFO + CSO working together on investment strategy
- Organizations with substantial CSO involvement are **88x more likely** to achieve high ROI across all 46 KPIs
- Use when: evaluating governance structure for tech/AI investments

**NOMAD Economy Archetypes**
- **N**urturers (purpose/community), **O**perators (automation/stewardship), **M**akers (ideas to reality), **A**dventurers (markets/ventures), **D**irectors (systems/values)
- Use when: workforce planning, talent ramp design

**Three-Tier Hybrid Architecture**
- Cloud (elasticity/variable workloads) + On-premises (consistency/predictable) + Edge (immediacy/latency-sensitive)
- Tipping point: When cloud costs reach **60-70% of equivalent hardware costs** → evaluate on-premises
- Edge trigger: Applications requiring **<10ms response time** cannot tolerate cloud delays

**Autonomy Spectrum**
- Augmentation (agents enhance humans) → Automation (agents automate tasks) → True Autonomy (minimal oversight)
- Use when: scoping AI agent deployment boundaries

### Decision Rules
- "Redesign, don't automate" — automating bad processes creates "paving the cow path"
- Capability-first → Need-first: shift from "What can we do?" to "What should we do?"
- High-performing orgs are **22x more likely** to openly discuss decision-making strategies
- "Stagility": balance stability workers crave with agility organizations need

### AI Scaling Metrics
- 84% of organizations increasing AI investments; 78% of leaders more confident
- Only **25%** have moved 40%+ of AI experiments to production (benchmark for "Early Scalers")
- Only **11%** have deployed agentic systems in production despite 38% piloting
- **40% of agentic AI projects** will fail by 2027 (Gartner)
- Token costs dropped **280-fold** in 2 years, but usage explosion keeps bills in tens of millions
- People using coding agents are **10x more productive**
- AI startups scale from $1M to $30M revenue **5x faster** than SaaS companies

### Workforce Metrics
- 4 out of 10 workers/managers/executives feel "always" or "often" exhausted
- 36% of companies expect 10%+ of jobs fully automated within a year
- 70% of tech leaders plan to grow teams in response to GenAI (augmentation, not replacement)
- Only 28% of workers have "pilot" mindset; 72% feel like "passengers"
- 84% of companies have NOT redesigned jobs around AI
- **15% of day-to-day decisions** will be made autonomously by 2028 (up from 0% in 2024)
- 65% of CIOs now report to CEOs (up from 41% in 2015)
- 66% of large enterprises view tech org as "revenue generator" vs service center

### Warnings
- "Paving the cow path": automating existing processes without redesigning = agent washing
- Proof-of-Concept Trap: pilot failures that were learning opportunities become business risks in production
- Shadow AI: unsanctioned deployment creates governance blind spots
- Pilot Fatigue: "executing a hundred pilots without a clear roadmap leads to poor results"

### Governance
- Three M's: **Map** (track progress), **Measure** (check outcomes), **Monitor** (ensure quality)
- Embedded governance: policies as living assets, codified and monitored automatically
- AI oversight trending toward audit committee responsibility at board level

### Signature Frameworks

**Target Operating Model (TOM) — 6 Layers**
1. Technology (environments/integrations)
2. Performance insights & data (KPIs/governance)
3. Governance (segregation of duties, controls, policies)

- Speed advantage of M&A only realized when integration treated as value creation from earliest stages
- "Fixating on existing risks can lead to paralysis"
- "Wait-and-see is rarely a winning strategy"
- Embed AI into core processes, don't layer tools onto existing complexity

### Leadership Model
- Human-centered transformation enhances productivity by **2.6x**
- Flat networks > hierarchical trees for agility
- North Star direction > rigid roadmap for transformation execution
- Responsible AI = performance lever, not compliance exercise

### Key Benchmarks (EY)
