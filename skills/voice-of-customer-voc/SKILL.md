# Voice of Customer (VoC) Skill

Use this skill when the task requires: conducting customer interviews, designing surveys, analyzing qualitative feedback, extracting positioning insights, refining messaging, understanding customer jobs-to-be-done, or translating customer language into copy.

**Critical for GSG:** Understanding parent decision drivers, refining brand positioning, extracting testimonials, improving student/parent satisfaction.

---

## 1. VOC FUNDAMENTALS

### What is Voice of Customer?
**Definition:** Systematically capturing, analyzing, and acting on customer feedback to understand their needs, preferences, and pain points in their own words.

**Why It Matters:**
- **Quantitative data** (CPA, conversion rate) tells you *what* happened
- **VoC** tells you *why* it happened and *how* to fix it

**Use Cases:**
- Messaging and positioning (speak customer language, not internal jargon)
- Product development (what features/programs matter most)
- Retention strategy (why customers stay vs leave)
- Competitive intelligence (why customers chose you vs competitor)

---

## 2. VOC RESEARCH METHODS

### Method 1: One-on-One Interviews (Depth)
**When to Use:** Need deep understanding, explore "why" behind behaviors

**Format:**
- Duration: 30-60 minutes
- Sample size: 10-20 interviews (saturation typically reached)
- Compensation: Gift card or discount

**Interview Guide Structure:**
1. **Warm-up (5 mins):** Build rapport, explain purpose
2. **Context (10 mins):** Understand their situation, background
3. **Core questions (30 mins):** Explore decision process, needs, pain points
4. **Wrap-up (5 mins):** Anything we missed? Referrals?

**Best Practices:**
- Open-ended questions ("Tell me about..." vs "Do you like...?")
- Follow the energy (dig deeper when they get animated)
- Silence is okay (let them think, don't rush to fill gaps)
- Record with permission (focus on conversation, not notes)

---

### Method 2: Surveys (Breadth)
**When to Use:** Need quantifiable data from large sample, validate hypotheses

**Format:**
- Duration: 5-10 minutes
- Sample size: 100-500+ responses
- Response rate: 20-40% (with incentive)

**Question Types:**
- **Multiple choice:** Quick, easy to analyze
- **Rating scales:** Likert (1-5), NPS (0-10)
- **Open-ended:** Capture nuance (analyze with text analysis tools)
- **Ranking:** Force prioritization

**Survey Design Principles:**
- Start with easy questions (build momentum)
- Group related questions (logical flow)
- Keep it short (<10 questions ideal)
- Avoid leading questions ("How much do you love our school?" -> "How satisfied are you?")
- Always include 1-2 open-ended (capture unexpected insights)

---

### Method 3: Focus Groups (Interaction)
**When to Use:** Explore reactions to concepts, generate ideas, observe group dynamics

**Format:**
- Duration: 60-90 minutes
- Participants: 6-10 people
- Compensation: Per person incentive

**Structure:**
1. Introductions and ground rules
2. Warm-up discussion
3. Stimulus presentation (concept, prototype, messaging)
4. Reactions and discussion
5. Wrap-up and debrief

**Cautions:**
- Groupthink (dominant voices suppress others)
- Social desirability bias (say what sounds good vs truth)
- Moderator skill critical (keep on track, ensure all voices heard)

---

### Method 4: Observational Research (Behavior)
**When to Use:** Understand actual behavior (not self-reported)

**Examples:**
- Shadow customers during key moments (what do they notice? ask about?)
- Watch form completion (where do they hesitate? abandon?)
- Observe service interactions (communication patterns, concerns)

**Value:** Reveals unconscious behaviors that interviews miss

---

### Method 5: Passive Listening (Always-On)
**When to Use:** Continuous feedback without active research

**Sources:**
- Support tickets (recurring complaints)
- Sales call recordings (objections, questions)
- Online reviews (Google, Facebook)
- Social media mentions
- Community forums (WhatsApp groups)

**Tools:**
- Text analysis (categorize common themes)
- Sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral)

---

## 3. INTERVIEW FRAMEWORKS

### Framework 1: Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)
**Philosophy:** People don't buy products, they "hire" them to do a job

**Interview Structure:**
1. **Situation:** "Tell me about when you first started looking..."
2. **Triggers:** "What made you realize you needed to switch/enroll?"
3. **Alternatives:** "What other options did you consider? Why not those?"
4. **Anxieties:** "What were you worried about when making this decision?"
5. **Decision criteria:** "What ultimately made you choose us?"
6. **Outcomes:** "How has it gone so far? What's better/worse than expected?"

**Output:** Job statement: "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]"

---

### Framework 2: The Five Whys
**Purpose:** Get to root cause, not surface symptoms

**Example:**
- Q: "Why did you choose this school?"
- A: "Because of the IB curriculum."
- Q: "Why was IB important?"
- A: "I want my child to have global exposure."
- Q: "Why is global exposure important?"
- A: "I studied abroad and it transformed my career."
- Q: "Why do you want that for your child?"
- A: "I don't want them limited to local-only opportunities."
- **Root motivation:** Career optionality, global mobility

**Use:** Dig past rational features to emotional drivers

---

### Framework 3: Before/After Grid
**Purpose:** Understand transformation customer seeks

| Dimension | Before (Problem State) | After (Desired State) |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Have | Struggling with local school quality | Child in top-tier school |
| Feel | Anxious about child's future | Confident in child's preparation |
| Average Day | Dealing with complaints | Positive updates |
| Status | Concerned parent | Proud parent |

**Interview Questions:**
- "Describe what life was like before you enrolled here..."
- "What's different now?"
- "How do you feel about your child's education now vs then?"

**Output:** Copy that mirrors transformation

---

### Framework 4: Objection Archaeology
**Purpose:** Uncover and address hidden concerns

**Interview Flow:**
1. "What almost stopped you from enrolling?"
2. "What did friends/family say when you told them about this decision?"
3. "What's the biggest risk you felt you were taking?"
4. "If you could change one thing, what would it be?"

**Output:** List of objections -> Address proactively in marketing

---

## 4. SURVEY DESIGN

### Survey Structure (Template)

**Section 1: Screening (2 questions)**
- Ensure respondent fits target profile

**Section 2: Context (2-3 questions)**
- Understand their situation

**Section 3: Core Questions (5-7 questions)**
- Explore key research objectives
- Mix of quantitative (rating scales) and qualitative (open-ended)

**Section 4: NPS (1 question)**
- "On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend us?"
- Follow-up: "What's the main reason for your score?"

**Section 5: Demographics (2-3 questions)**
- For segmentation

**Section 6: Thank You**
- Offer incentive
- Ask for follow-up interview volunteers

---

### Question Types & Examples

**Rating Scales:**
```
How satisfied are you with the academic quality?
1 - Very Dissatisfied
2 - Dissatisfied
3 - Neutral
4 - Satisfied
5 - Very Satisfied
```

**Ranking:**
```
Rank the following factors in order of importance:
___ Academic reputation
___ Fee affordability
___ Location/commute
___ Curriculum type
___ Extracurricular programs
```

**Open-Ended:**
```
What's the one thing we could improve to make your experience better?
[Text box]
```

**Conditional Logic:**
```
If NPS score < 7:
"What would it take for you to rate us higher?"

If NPS score >= 9:
"Would you be willing to provide a testimonial?"
```

---

### Survey Distribution

| Channel | Pros | Cons | Best Practice |
|---------|------|------|---------------|
| **Email** | Targeted, trackable | Low response (10-20%) | Send from personal name |
| **In-App / Portal** | High visibility | May feel intrusive | Trigger after positive event |
| **SMS** | High open rate (90%+) | Character limit | Short NPS + link to full |
| **QR Code** | Easy at events | Requires smartphone | Visible incentive |

---

## 5. ANALYZING QUALITATIVE DATA

### Step 1: Transcription
- Record interviews (with permission)
- Transcribe (Otter.ai, Rev.com, or manual)

### Step 2: Coding (Thematic Analysis)
1. Read through all transcripts
2. Identify recurring themes/patterns
3. Create codes (labels for concepts)
4. Tag quotes with codes
5. Group codes into higher-level themes

**Example Codes:**
- Decision factors: `curriculum`, `reputation`, `location`, `fees`
- Pain points: `communication_gap`, `facility_quality`, `teacher_turnover`
- Desired outcomes: `university_placement`, `confidence_building`, `global_exposure`

### Step 3: Synthesis
| Theme | Frequency | Sample Quote | Insight |
|-------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Curriculum quality | 18/20 | "IB prepares them for global universities" | Lead with curriculum in messaging |
| Teacher experience | 12/20 | "Teachers here actually care" | Highlight teacher credentials |
| Facilities | 5/20 | "Labs could be better" | Low priority, not a decision driver |

### Step 4: Personas
**Segment customers based on themes:**

**Persona 1: Aspiring Global Parent**
- Motivation: Child's global career
- Decision driver: Curriculum, international exposure
- Anxieties: Child won't be competitive globally
- Copy angle: "Prepare your child for the world"

**Persona 2: Academic Achiever Parent**
- Motivation: Top university placement
- Decision driver: Past outcomes, achievements
- Anxieties: Child won't get into top university
- Copy angle: "80% of students place in top-10 universities"

**Persona 3: Community-Focused Parent**
- Motivation: Values alignment, peer group
- Decision driver: School culture, parent community
- Anxieties: Wrong influence on child
- Copy angle: "A community of families who value education and character"

---

## 6. TRANSLATING VOC INTO MARKETING

### Voice of Customer -> Messaging

**Step 1: Extract Customer Language**
- Identify words/phrases customers actually use
- Avoid internal jargon

**Step 2: Map to Benefits**
| Customer Quote | Underlying Need | Benefit Statement |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| "I want them to be confident" | Self-esteem | "Build confidence through hands-on projects" |
| "I worry about college admissions" | Future security | "Track record: 95% top-university acceptance" |
| "Teachers should care about my child" | Personalized attention | "Small class sizes, teachers know every student" |

**Step 3: Create Messaging Hierarchy**
1. **Main headline:** Address #1 need (most frequently mentioned)
2. **Subheadline:** Support with proof point
3. **Body copy:** Address 2nd and 3rd needs
4. **CTA:** Overcome #1 objection

---

### Voice of Customer -> Value Proposition

**Jobs to Be Done Canvas:**

**For:** [Target customer]
**Who:** [Primary need/desire]
**Our product** is [category]
**That:** [Key benefit]
**Unlike:** [Alternatives]
**We:** [Key differentiator with proof]

---

### Voice of Customer -> Testimonials

**Testimonial Formula:**
1. **Problem:** What was life like before?
2. **Solution:** What did you do? (chose us)
3. **Result:** What changed?
4. **Emotion:** How do you feel now?

**Example (from interview):**
> "My daughter went from bored to engaged in just 6 months. The IB curriculum challenged her in ways our previous school never did. Now I'm confident she'll achieve her dream of studying abroad." -- Parent

---

## 7. VOC FOR RETENTION (CHURN ANALYSIS)

### Exit Interviews
**When:** Customer withdraws or doesn't renew

**Key Questions:**
1. "What's the main reason you're leaving?"
2. "Was there a specific moment when you decided to leave?"
3. "What could we have done differently to keep you?"
4. "Where are you going instead? Why there vs here?"
5. "Would you consider returning in the future?"

**Analysis:**
- Categorize reasons: Financial, relocation, dissatisfaction, competitor
- Identify preventable vs unpreventable churn
- Fix root causes for preventable

### NPS Follow-Up Interviews
**Detractor Interview (score 0-6):**
1. "Thank you for your honest feedback. Can you tell me more?"
2. "What's the biggest frustration?"
3. "If you could change one thing, what would it be?"
4. "Would you be open to us following up after we address this?"

**Promoter Interview (score 9-10):**
1. "What do you love most?"
2. "Would you share your experience with others?"
3. "Any suggestions for improvement?"

---

- Minimum: 10 interviews (theme saturation)
- Ideal: 15-20 per segment

**Focus Groups:**
- 2-3 groups per topic
- 6-8 participants each

---

## 9. ADVANCED VOC TECHNIQUES

### Technique 1: Max Diff Analysis (Prioritization)
**Purpose:** Force trade-offs, reveal true priorities

**How it works:**
- Present 3-5 features at a time
- Ask: "Which is most important? Least important?"
- Repeat with different combinations
- Algorithm calculates relative importance scores

**Value:** Reveals true priorities (people say "all are important" but Max Diff forces choices)

---

### Technique 2: Conjoint Analysis (Trade-Offs)
**Purpose:** Understand willingness to pay, feature value

**How it works:**
- Present combinations of attributes at different levels
- Ask: "Which would you choose?"
- Statistical model estimates value of each attribute

---

### Technique 3: Sentiment Analysis (Text Mining)
**Purpose:** Analyze large volumes of text feedback

**Tools:** Python (TextBlob, VADER), MonkeyLearn, Lexalytics

**Process:**
1. Collect open-ended responses, reviews, support tickets
2. Run sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral)
3. Identify most positive/negative topics
4. Extract key phrases

---

## 10. VOC MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Mistake 1: Only Talking to Happy Customers
**Fix:** Actively seek out detractors, churned customers

### Mistake 2: Leading Questions
**Fix:** "Tell me about your experience" not "How much do you love us?"

### Mistake 3: Ignoring the Data
**Fix:** VoC -> Insight -> Action -> Communication loop

### Mistake 4: Asking What They Want (Not Why)
**Fix:** Understand underlying needs, then design solutions

### Mistake 5: Over-Reliance on Surveys
**Fix:** Balance quantitative (surveys) with qualitative (interviews)

---

## 14. GSG APPLICATION (Confirmed Intel — HIGH Confidence)

### Confirmed VoC Findings (Arsenal + Exit Interviews)

| Finding | Source | Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Parents hire for "global mobility," not "IB curriculum" | JTBD interviews | +22% conversion after messaging pivot |
| 40% of churn caused by "communication gaps" (not fees) | Exit interviews | Weekly parent updates → -2.1% churn |
| Summer camp attendees have 2.1x higher retention | Retention cohort analysis | Summer trial now mandatory recommendation |
| Referred parents convert at 42% vs 4% cold leads | CRM cohort data | Word-of-mouth > paid for enrollment quality |

### Active VoC Gap (BLOCKED — Feb 2026)
**OWIS India repositioning is BLOCKED** — no VoC data to validate new positioning.
This is a live HIGH-priority gap. ANALYST must commission VoC before CREATIVE can reposition.
- Research needed: 10-15 parent interviews, OWIS current + prospective
- Block expires when: VoC report delivered to STRATEGIST

### GSG Parent Personas (Confirmed from JTBD Interviews)

**Persona 1: Aspiring Global Parent (PRIMARY)**
- JTBD: "Help my child access global universities and careers I couldn't reach"
- Decision driver: International curriculum, global mobility outcomes
- Anxieties: "Will this actually open doors outside India?"
- Confirmed trigger: University placement outcomes, alumni career tracking
- **Copy angle**: "Your child, globally prepared" (NOT "IB curriculum features")

**Persona 2: Academic Achiever Parent**
- JTBD: "Get my child into IIT/Oxbridge/Ivy League"
- Decision driver: Academic rigor, past placement record
- Anxieties: "Will they be competitive vs CBSE peers?"
- **Copy angle**: "Top university results, consistently"

**Persona 3: Community-Focused Parent**
- JTBD: "Surround my child with the right peer group and values"
- Decision driver: School culture, parent community quality
- Anxieties: "Wrong influence on child"
- **Copy angle**: "A community of families who invest in their children's future"

### GSG-Specific Interview Guide (Parent Decision Research)

**Opening (5 mins):**
"Tell me about when you first started researching schools for your child..."

**JTBD Core (20 mins):**
1. "What was happening in your family when you decided to start looking seriously?"
2. "What were you worried your child would miss out on if you stayed at your current school?"
3. "Walk me through the moment you decided on [school] — what pushed you over the line?"
4. "What would have to happen for you to consider leaving?"

**Inversion Questions (10 mins):**
5. "What almost stopped you from enrolling here?"
6. "When you told other parents, what did they say?"
7. "What's the one thing you wish we communicated better?"

**Retention Signals (5 mins):**
8. "How often do you get updates from the school? Is it enough?"
9. "Have you recommended this school to anyone? What did you tell them?"

### Communication Gap Protocol (Most Common GSG Churn Driver)
Exit interviews confirmed: 40% of churn = parents feel "disconnected from school."

**Signals of communication gap forming (monitor these):**
- Parent hasn't opened school portal in 7+ days
- No attendance at parent events in 30+ days
- NPS score drops below 7
- WhatsApp group activity declining (Pune — confirmed MEDIUM risk, Feb 2026)

**Standard response:** Proactive personal outreach within 48 hours of any signal.
