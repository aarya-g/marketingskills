# Link Building & Outreach Skill

Use this skill when the task requires: acquiring backlinks, guest posting, digital PR campaigns, HARO outreach, building domain authority, or creating referral traffic from external sites.

**Critical for GSG:** Building campus website authority, securing education media coverage, generating referral traffic from parenting blogs/forums.

---

## 1. LINK BUILDING FUNDAMENTALS

### What are Backlinks?
**Definition:** Links from external websites pointing to your site

**Why They Matter:**
- **SEO:** Google uses backlinks as vote of confidence (more quality links = higher rankings)
- **Referral traffic:** People click links -> visit your site
- **Brand authority:** Being mentioned by reputable sites builds credibility

**Quality vs Quantity:**
- 1 link from a major publication > 100 links from spam sites
- Domain authority, relevance, and context matter

---

### Types of Backlinks

**1. Editorial Links (Best)**
- Earned naturally (no outreach needed)
- Example: Education blogger references your school in article

**2. Outreach Links**
- Acquired via proactive outreach (guest posts, partnerships)
- Example: You write guest post for parenting blog

**3. Self-Created (Low Value)**
- Forum signatures, blog comments, directory submissions
- Often ignored or penalized by Google

**4. Paid Links (Risky)**
- Pay for placement
- Against Google guidelines (can result in penalties)

---

### Link Attributes

**DoFollow (Pass SEO Value):**
```html
<a href="https://example.com">School Name</a>
```

**NoFollow (Don't Pass SEO Value, Still Drive Traffic):**
```html
<a href="https://example.com" rel="nofollow">School Name</a>
```

**Ideal:** Mix of both (looks natural to Google)

---

## 2. LINK BUILDING STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: Guest Posting
**What:** Write articles for other websites in exchange for backlink

**Process:**
1. Identify target blogs (parenting, education, local news)

**Example Pitch:**
```

Would this be a good fit for [Blog Name]?

Best,

- **Contextual:** Surrounded by relevant text
- **DoFollow:** Passes SEO value
- **Traffic:** Site gets visitors (not dormant)

### Low-Quality / Spammy Link Indicators
- **Irrelevant:** Link from gambling, pharma, random blog
- **Low DA:** <20 domain authority
- **Link Farm:** Site exists only to sell links
- **Over-Optimized Anchor:** Exact match keyword stuffing
- **Reciprocal:** "I'll link to you if you link to me" (obvious exchange)

**Disavow:** If toxic links build up, use Google Search Console Disavow Tool

## 6. ANCHOR TEXT STRATEGY

### Anchor Text Types

**1. Branded:** `<a href="...">School Name</a>`

**4. Generic:** `<a href="...">click here</a>` or `<a href="...">learn more</a>`

**Ideal Distribution:**
- 40% Branded

- 10% Naked URL

**Avoid:** 100% exact match (looks manipulative to Google)

**Problem:** 80% of links come after 2-3 follow-ups
**Fix:** Follow up 2x (5 days, 10 days after initial)

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Internal Links

**Plus:**
- Brand authority (hard to quantify)
- Long-term compounding (links stay, keep driving traffic)
