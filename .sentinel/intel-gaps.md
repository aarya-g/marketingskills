# RECON Intel Registry

Tracks confirmed data, flagged assumptions, and open intel gaps.
RECON reads this before every Wave/Full-team execution.

## PRIMARY INTEL SOURCE: NOTION
Search Notion FIRST before logging any gap. Key pages:
- "India Intel + K12" database — market structure, consumer, K-12 sector intel
- "GSG Marketing: 100x Monopoly Workflow System" — workflow + playbooks
- "COMMAND CENTER: Marketing War Room" — active campaigns, live priorities
- "THE ARSENAL: 11 Skills Playbook" — frameworks already mapped
- "PLAYBOOKS: Pre-Built Battle Plans" — pre-built execution plans
- "GSG Ethical Operating Principles" — ethical red lines

SECONDARY SOURCE: HubSpot MCP — live CRM, pipeline, enrollment, lead data

Only log gaps that are NOT found in Notion or HubSpot.
