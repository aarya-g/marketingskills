# RECON Intel Registry

Tracks confirmed data, flagged assumptions, and open intel gaps.
RECON reads this before every Wave/Full-team execution.

---

## Confidence Levels
- **HIGH** — Actual GSG data confirmed. Agents proceed.
- **MEDIUM** — Industry benchmarks used. Agents proceed, flag assumptions in output.
- **LOW** — No data. Agents will fabricate. RECON researches or surfaces to Aar.

---

## Confirmed Intel (HIGH confidence)
<!-- Add entries as GSG data is confirmed -->

---

## Flagged Assumptions (MEDIUM confidence)
<!-- Entries: [topic] — [assumption used] — [source] — [date flagged] -->

---

## Open Intel Gaps (LOW confidence — blocks reliable execution)
<!-- Entries: [topic] — [which agent is blocked] — [date logged] — [status] -->

---

## Closed Gaps (resolved)
<!-- Move entries here once intel is confirmed -->
